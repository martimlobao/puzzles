## Problem

As with all puzzles from TED-Ed's YouTube channel, you're best served by watching the video explaining the problem. Be sure to stop by [1:56](https://youtu.be/qgvmJTmJIKs?t=116) to avoid spoilers.

The gist of the problem boils down to the following: there is a magic bag that will give you gold coins depending on the number you put in. The way the bag works follows these rules:

1. The bag works consistently: if you put in a given number of coins, it will always produce the same result.
2. The bag always increases the number of coins you put in.
3. The more coins you put in, the more coins will be returned. For example, putting in 3 gold coins will produce more coins than if you had put in 2 coins.
4. If you use the bag twice (i.e. if you put in a certain number of coins, remove all the coins produced, place them all back in the bag again and then remove them once more), then the final number of coins will be exactly 3 times the initial amount.
5. The bag always produces a whole number of coins. No fractional coins allowed.

The problem is to find out **how many coins will come out of the bag if you place 13 coins and use the bag only once** (not twice).

## Bonus problem

Can you come up with a closed formula for the number of coins that comes out of the bag after one placement?
